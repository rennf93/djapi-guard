description: DjAPI Guard (import djangoapi_guard), the Django security middleware over guard-core. Use when securing Django apps with IP filtering, rate limiting, penetration detection, security headers, cloud-provider blocking, route-level security decorators, or behavioral rules; when wiring DjangoAPIGuard into MIDDLEWARE and configuring GUARD_SECURITY_CONFIG in settings; when adapting sync HttpRequest/HttpResponse types to guard-core's GuardRequest/GuardResponse protocols; or when debugging sync-callable requirements, Redis connectivity, decorator-route visibility via _guard_route_id and set_decorator_handler, or pytest-django test setup (tests.settings, RequestFactory fixtures). Also use when porting fastapi-guard or flaskapi-guard patterns to Django or choosing the right Guard adapter.

# DjAPI Guard

Security middleware for Django: IP filtering, rate limiting, signature-based attack-pattern detection, security headers, and route-level security decorators. Import package is `djangoapi_guard` (distribution name `djapi-guard`). Current as of djapi-guard 4.3.0 over guard-core 3.15+.

DjAPI Guard is a thin adapter: all security logic (models, handlers, decorators, detection engine, protocols) lives in `guard_core`; this package only bridges Django to it through the unasync-generated `guard_core.sync` mirror. Everything is synchronous.

## Quick Reference

* Install: `uv add djapi-guard` (or `pip install djapi-guard`).
* Wire the middleware: add `djangoapi_guard.middleware.DjangoAPIGuard` to `MIDDLEWARE` and set `GUARD_SECURITY_CONFIG = SecurityConfig(...)` in settings; see [Setup](#setup).
* All behavior is guard-core's `SecurityConfig`; do not mutate handlers directly.
* Route rules: `SecurityDecorator` from the sync mirror writes per-route `RouteConfig` the middleware resolves at request time via `_guard_route_id` on view functions.
* Register the decorator handler (`middleware.set_decorator_handler`) so decorator-only checks are built into the pipeline.
* Sync only: custom callables must be plain functions, Redis uses `redis.Redis`, IP comes from `request.META`.

## Installation

```bash
uv add djapi-guard             # or: pip install djapi-guard
```

Requires Python 3.10-3.13 and `guard-core>=3.15.0` (installed automatically). `import djangoapi_guard` pulls the `guard_core.sync` mirror, not the async tree.

## Setup

```python
# settings.py
from djangoapi_guard import SecurityConfig

MIDDLEWARE = [
    # Add DjAPI Guard middleware early in the stack
    "djangoapi_guard.middleware.DjangoAPIGuard",
    "django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware",
    # ...
]

GUARD_SECURITY_CONFIG = SecurityConfig(
    whitelist=["192.168.1.0/24"],
    blacklist=["10.0.0.1"],
    auto_ban_threshold=5,
    auto_ban_duration=86400,
)
```

`GUARD_SECURITY_CONFIG` must be a `SecurityConfig` instance; when the setting is absent the middleware falls back to `SecurityConfig()` defaults. `DjangoAPIGuard` follows the standard Django middleware contract (`__init__(get_response)` / `__call__(request)`); it initializes Redis, geo IP, cloud ranges, and the agent handler lazily, runs the 17-check `SecurityCheckPipeline` from `guard_core.sync` on each request (first non-`None` `HttpResponse` blocks), handles CORS preflight explicitly, and finalizes passing responses through the response factory (headers, CORS, metrics, behavioral return rules). `middleware.agent_stats` exposes the agent's live buffer drop counters and circuit-breaker state for health-check views.

## Route-Level Security Decorators

Decorators from `guard_core.sync.decorators` write per-route `RouteConfig` objects. The middleware's route resolver maps Django URL patterns to those configs via the `_guard_route_id` attribute set on view functions, for both function-based and class-based views. Pass your `SecurityDecorator` to `middleware.set_decorator_handler` so the pipeline is derived from the registered routes; checks that only decorators can trigger (auth, referrer, required headers, custom validators, time window, request size/content) are built only when the middleware can see the route config.

`RouteConfig.bypassed_checks` accepts only recognized tokens (`all`, `ip_ban`, `ip`, `clouds`, `rate_limit`, `penetration`); an unknown token is dropped with a warning, so a typo cannot make a check look disabled while it stays enforced.

## Sync-Only Surface

* Custom callables (custom checks, validators, response modifiers, `auth_verifier`) must be plain sync functions; async callables raise `TypeError` under Django's WSGI model.
* Per-request state lives on attributes attached to the Django request object; route identity is carried by `_guard_route_id` on view functions.
* IP extraction is proxy-aware from `request.META` (`REMOTE_ADDR` / `X-Forwarded-For`).
* Redis (`redis.Redis`) and outbound HTTP (`httpx.Client`) are synchronous, mirroring guard-core's sync handlers.

## Footguns

* **`GUARD_SECURITY_CONFIG` must be a `SecurityConfig` instance.** A plain dict from older docs is not converted by the middleware; construct `SecurityConfig(**settings_dict)` in settings if you keep a dict around.
* **`enable_redis` defaults to `True`** with `redis_url="redis://localhost:6379"`. Without a reachable Redis, stateful checks fail; set `enable_redis=False` in no-Redis environments or point at a real instance.
* **Async callables are rejected.** Any `async def` custom check, validator, or modifier raises `TypeError`; convert to a sync function.
* **Decorator-only checks vanish without a decorator handler.** Without `set_decorator_handler`, decorator-triggered checks are not built and their rules never fire.
* **`passive_mode=True` logs but never blocks.** Use it to trial rules; switch to `False` once logs confirm the traffic you expect.
* **Tests need Django settings.** The suite uses pytest-django with `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE = "tests.settings"` from pyproject; new test modules should not call `django.setup()` themselves.
